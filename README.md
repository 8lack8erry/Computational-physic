## Features

### ODE Solvers
The library supports several methods for solving systems of ODEs:
- **Euler Method (Eulero)**
- **Runge-Kutta 2nd Order (RK2)**
- **Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4)**

These solvers are implemented as template functions, providing flexibility in data types.

### Numerical Integration
The library provides the following methods for definite integration:
- **Trapezoidal Rule**
- **Simpson's Rule**
- **Romberg Integration**
- **Gaussian Quadratures**
  - Legendre Polynomials
  - Laguerre Polynomials
  - Hermite Polynomials
- **Monte Carlo Methods**
  - Standard Monte Carlo Integration
  - Hit-or-Miss Method

### Root Finding
The library offers algorithms for finding the roots of functions:
- **Bisection Method**
- **Newton-Raphson Method**
